# Generating Tileable Textures for 3D Rendering.

## Abstract: 

In 3D rendering sometimes it is very important to be abble to repeat a texture side by side multiple times without "seams" between the repetitions in order to save both memory and artistic effort. This is known as a tileable or seamless texture, along with it, lots of texture maps are used to allow faking ligthining effects, those could include, but are not limited to: height, normal and roughness maps. The program will, given the photo of a surface, with any resolution and close to uniform ligthining and texture, generate a tileable Power of Two texture (one that has dimensions (width,height) equals to (2^p, 2^q), being p and q natural numbers) and its normal, height and roughness maps.

### Tiling the Texture:

The tiling process is probably one of the hardest parts of the project, so it was decided to get the map generation working first. But some research was done and a possible solution was found, this solution tries to automate what an artist would generally attempt when tiling a texture. The idea is to first select a square region of the input image with a power of two resolution, then put two instances of the image side-by-side horizontally, remove the seam on the center, following, take the central square from the generated rectangle as a new texture and repeat the process vertically. For removing the seams, algorithms like "Best Tile" and "Min Cut" are being considered, also simulating the "Patch" tool that can be in found in programs like GIMP and Photoshop is a possibility, the problem is that this tool normally relies in the judgment of the artist to achieve good results, so an algorithm to analise how to use the tool would be necessary.

#### Grayscale Conversion:

Most of the texture maps that need to be generated are created from grayscale images, so a function to convert the input image (for now, before tiling) was added. The process consists in converting the image to HSV, and uginsg the V channel.texture_sample01_result_height.png

### Height Map:

The height map is generated by leveling and gamma correcting the grayscale image. Presently, hard coded values that produce good results in most situations are being used, but some analysis and user customization is planned to be added. Current idea is to analise the histogram of the image to get the min and max relevant intensities (Ones that appear a reasonable amount of times in the image, so anomalous intensities that barely happen are discarded) and use those values for the input shadown and highlight parameters for the levels function, also, the user will be allowed to customize the midtones value. By assigning this values from histrogram, a larger difference between the minimum and maximum height is allowed, and with the midtone customization the user can control the height of the texture and steepeness of the trasitions. Also for more control the output shadow and highlight values will probably be customizable.

### Normal Map:

Throught the implementation details are still being researched, it was discovered that it's possible to convert height maps to normal maps, so, as height maps will also be generated, those will be used to create the normal maps.

---

### Roughness Map:

Similar to the height map, the roughness map is also generated by leveling and gamma correcting the grayscale, but the image is inverted before saving, making dark areas lighter on the final texture indicating more roughness, what will generate less light reflection in the 3D rendering. Like the height map, hard coded values are being used until better methods and customization is implemented. In this case, the input highlight and shadow value will probably be mantained, to make the roughness map more uniform, and the user will be abble to customize the midtones and the ouput shadow and highlight values.
