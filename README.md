# Generating Tileable Textures for 3D Rendering.

## Abstract: 

In 3D rendering sometimes it is very important to be abble to repeat a texture side by side multiple times without "seams" between the repetitions in order to save both memory and artistic effort. This is known as a tileable or seamless texture, along with it, lots of texture maps are used to allow faking ligthining effects, those could include, but are not limited to: height, normal and roughness maps. The program will, given the photo of a surface, with any resolution and close to uniform ligthining and texture, generate a tileable Power of Two texture (one that has dimensions (width,height) equals to (2^p, 2^q), being p and q natural numbers) and its normal, height and roughness maps.

## Example:

*Original image of the surface*

*Tileable version of the image, done by hand by an artist on GIMP.*

*3D rendered material, made using the tileable texture and its maps, rendered on Unity Engine. (OBS: note that Unity uses a different system for roughness map, for information on how to convert roughness map to the map used in Unity check the "TO DO" file in the tutorials folder)*
