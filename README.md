# Generating Tileable Textures and Texture Maps for 3D Rendering.

## Abstract: 

In 3D rendering sometimes it is very important to be abble to repeat a texture side by side multiple times without "seams" between the repetitions in order to save both memory and artistic effort. This is known as a tileable or seamless texture, along with it, lots of texture maps are used to allow faking ligthining effects, those could include, but are not limited to: height, normal and roughness maps. The program will, given the photo of a surface, with any resolution and close to uniform ligthining and texture, generate a tileable Power of Two texture (one that has dimensions (width,height) equals to (2^p, 2^q), being p and q natural numbers) and its normal, height and roughness maps.

### Tiling the Texture:

The tiling process is probably one of the hardest parts of the project, so it was decided to get the map generation working first. But some research was done and a possible solution was found, this solution tries to automate what an artist would generally attempt when tiling a texture. The idea is to first select a square region of the input image with a power of two resolution, then put two instances of the image side-by-side horizontally, remove the seam on the center, following, take the central square from the generated rectangle as a new texture and repeat the process vertically. For removing the seams, algorithms like "Best Tile" and "Min Cut" are being considered, also simulating the "Patch" tool that can be in found in programs like GIMP and Photoshop is a possibility, the problem is that this tool normally relies in the judgment of the artist to achieve good results, so an algorithm to analise how to use the tool would be necessary.

For now, what is being done is the slicing of the original image into a version with width and height being a power of two. The slice is selected between the four corners plus the center of the image using the standard deviation between the channel value differences as a criteria, the one with the minimum value is selected. This is done in an attempt to get the slice that would be, most of the time, easier to tile. Using the slice with the minimum standard deviation, generally the part of the image with the least texture and lighting variance, should allow for making tiles with better final appearence, as, though the image provided should be already pretty uniform,this would eliminate most of the remaining outlier regions.

#### Grayscale Conversion:

Most of the texture maps that need to be generated are created from grayscale images, so a function to convert the power of two image was added. The process consists in combining the RGB channels into one using the 0.229, 0.587 and 0.114 weights respectively.

### Height Map:

The height map is generated by leveling and gamma correcting the grayscale image. The histogram of the image is used to get the min and max relevant intensities (Ones that appear a reasonable amount of times in the image, so anomalous values that barely happen are discarded) in order to increase the intensity range for the height map, these values, along with an user customizable height multiplier, are used as parameters for the leveling and gamma correction function, generating better results and allowing user customization.

### Normal Map:

The normal map is generated using the height map as a base, transforming the grayscale value into vector space and them saving XYZ to RGB. The vector space values can be calculated via the discrete partial derivatives from the normalized height map. More details can be found on the bibliography [9].

### Roughness Map:

Similar to the height map, the roughness map is also generated by leveling and gamma correcting the grayscale, but the image is inverted before saving, making dark areas lighter on the final texture indicating more roughness, what will generate less light reflection in the 3D rendering. A value provided by the user is used as a parameter for the leveling and gamma correction, allowing some customization on how rough the texture will be.
